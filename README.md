## xc2018
This is a visualizer and emulator for XC2018 bitstreams.

It is based off Ken Shirriff's XC2064 tool: https://github.com/shirriff/xc2064

I have made the following changes to it:
* Adapted to the XC2018 (basically a scaled-up XC2064)
* Added (really ugly) route tracing code
* Added support for clock nets, fixed a couple bugs
* Added a simple emulator
